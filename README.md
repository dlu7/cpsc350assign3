#CPSC350 Assignment 3
#
#I referenced cplusplus.com and tutorialspoint.com for some guidance on fixing some of the errors I had with the
if/else statements and with the stack operations. I also used most of the code from the GenStack.h and GenStack.cpp 
files that we did in class when we were learning about stacks for my GenStack.h and GenStack.cpp files.
